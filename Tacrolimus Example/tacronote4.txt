POD>15:                                 Wean by 10% starting on POD 15
 
Antiinfectives:
Chlorhexidine 10 mL swish and spit TID
Fluconazole 174 mg IV q24h (3 mg/kg/dose), for fungal prophylaxis
Ganciclovir 289 mg IV q24h (5 mg/kg/dose), for viral prophylaxis
Piperacillin/tazobactam 3, 375 mg IV q6h post-operative antibiotic 
Bactrim 800/160 mg PO once every MWF, for PCP prophylaxis (start on 09/28) 
 
Other medications:
Amlodipine 10 mg PO qHS
ASA 81 mg PO daily 
Pantoprazole 40 mg IV q24h
Vitamin K 5  mg IV q24h x 3 days
Hydromorphone IV PCA
D5-1/2 NS + 20K IV 50 mL/hr 
Ondansetron 4 mg IV q8H for nausea, vomiting
Nalbuphine 2.9 mg IV q4H PRN for opioid associated pruritus (0.05 mg/kg/dose) 
Naloxone 0.0577 mg IV as directed for opioid associated respiratory depression (0.001 mg/kg/dose) 
 
Pharmacy considerations:
Pharmacy is aware of the recent transplant and will continue to follow Cameron for the duration of the hospitalization. All current medications and orders are appropriate for this patient based on renal function and liver transplant protocol, so there are no pharmacy concerns at this time.  I will ensure the steroid taper continues to follow protocol. Bactrim DS PO MWF for PCP prophylaxis is ordered to start on 09/28. Given high risk of CMV infection (CMV serologies are donor positive and recipient negative) Cameron will be transitioned to oral valganciclovir when tolerating enteral medications. He was started on aspirin for prophylaxis of hepatic artery thrombosis on 09/27. I will continue to discuss plan and recommendations with the PICU and liver transplant teams throughout PICU admission. Upon transfer to the floor medications will be further evaluated and discharge education will be conducted prior to transfer.  Please contact me with any further questions.
 
Thank you,
