Education: 
Benito Valdepenas provided medication education with Cameron'S family on 09/29/2020
The following information was discussed with the patient and/or family at the time of medication teaching:
·	Medication information including, but not limited to the following, was reviewed: medication trade and generic name, use, dosage form, route, dose, and administration schedule including expected duration of therapy, drug-food interactions, drug-drug interactions, drug storage, common and/or serious adverse effects, and what to do for missed doses.  
·	There are no anticipated activity restrictions due to the potential side effects of the listed discharge medications. 
·	Patient has been provided a medication calendar (via MedAction plan Pro) and the process to obtain medications including first fill and refills has been dicussed with the family.
 
The family acknowledged understanding of the medications and asked appropriate questions.  All questions and concerns were addressed.
 
I have discussed recommendations and plan with the liver transplant team and Cameron's transplant coordinator. 
 
Thank you,
